# #        ##   This plugin in order to capture XRayer quickly, might generate false positives for players who are lucky!   ##
# #  Warn  ##   Be careful not to set the VL threshold too low!                                                             ##
# #        ##   Don't detect for common ores either, you should only detect for rare ores!                                  ##
